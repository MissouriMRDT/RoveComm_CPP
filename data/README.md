# Data Directory

The **Data** directory is intended to store data files and resources used in the RoveComm C++ project. This directory focuses on organizing and managing various types of data that are essential for the project's functionality, analysis, or training.

## Guidelines

The following are the guidelines for organizing files within the **Data** directory:

1. Store data files in a structured manner based on their purpose, type, or source.
2. Use descriptive names for the files that reflect their content or purpose.
3. Consider creating subdirectories within the **Data** directory to further categorize the data based on specific criteria or usage.
4. Include a README file in the **Data** directory or subdirectories to provide additional information about the data files, their format, or any relevant details.

## Usage

Here are some common types of data files or directories you might find within the **Data** directory:

1. **Configuration files**: Files containing configuration data or settings used by different components or modules of the RoveComm C++ project, such as calibration parameters, control parameters, network protocols, or environment specifications.
2. **Log files**: Files or directories containing log data captured during the execution or operation of the RoveComm C++ project, providing valuable information for debugging, analysis, or performance evaluation.

Remember to update this README file whenever new data files or resources are added to the **Data** directory, providing a brief summary of each data file's purpose and content.

Ensure that the data files are appropriately integrated with the project's code and workflows, enabling easy access and usage when required.

Manage the data files carefully, keeping backups and ensuring compliance with any data protection or privacy regulations.

Happy organizing and utilizing the data!
