# ASCII Directory

The **ASCII** directory is intended to store Text files that provide software headers for RoveComm C++.

## Guidelines

The following are the guidelines for organizing files within the **ASCII** directory:

1. Each Text file should contain "RoveComm" followed by the major software version. Example: `RoveComm v3`
2. Use https://patorjk.com/software/taag/#p=display&f=Small to create your text file to match the formatting from past years.

Remember to update this README file whenever new ASCII files are added to the directory, providing a brief summary of each file's purpose and functionality.

Manage the data files carefully, keeping backups and ensuring compliance with any data protection or privacy regulations.

Happy organizing and utilizing the data!
