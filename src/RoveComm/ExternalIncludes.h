 * @brief Since this project is setup as a library sometimes we need to access
 *        our logger and globals from the host application and othertimes, in
 *        the case that we are testing directly within our stand-alone
 *        application we need to access our logger and globals from within
 *        the repository but not necissarily from within the library itself.
 *
 *        The macro, __ROVECOMM_LIBRARY_MODE__, is how we can detect within
 *        RoveComm for High Level C++ Applications which mode we are running
 *        in and will tell us what can be included.
